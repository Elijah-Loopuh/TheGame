Collision notes:
	
	assign multiple layers to use one hitbox for multiple things
	
	layer 1 is for physics:
		-walls
		-locked doors
		-anything that will collide and stop, slide, bounce off other objects
		
	layer 2 is for hurtboxes (the damage detectors):
		-anything with health, such as players, enemies, bosses, etc
		-anything that causes damage
